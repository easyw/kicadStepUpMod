*kicad StepUp 3D mechanical exporter* for collaborative exchange between KiCad and FreeCAD/MCAD;
With *kicad StepUp*, it is possible to work in kicad EDA with the same component model data
available in the *STEP AP214 3D format*, and obtain a 3D STEP AP214 model of the pcb board and
a complete board assemblies with electronic modules, to be used for *MCAD interchange*.
The accurate 3D visualization of components on board assemblies in kicad 3dviewer, is
maintained in the same accuracy and aspect in STEP AP214 format. +
The *kicad StepUp* maintains the usual way to work with kicad, but improves the process
to work in a collaborative way with mechanical designers bringing near ECAD and MCAD environments. +
With kicad StepUp you’ll get an exact representation of your physical board in Native 3D PCB
v7.2.1.6 April 2018
